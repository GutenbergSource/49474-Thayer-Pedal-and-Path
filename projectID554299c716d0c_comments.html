<HTML><BODY>Before America acquired its current addiction to the automobile, it enthusiastically adopted the bicycle, and Americans where famous for using them everywhere. Not much of that remains, but this lovely little book details the trip of a Connecticut businessman through some of America's famous landmarks by bicycle; and since we are speaking 1887, this was not a 21-gear racer, but a good old 'ordinary', one of those machines with a huge front-wheel, and a much smaller wheel behind, of which we all wonder how on earth they could actually ride them at all, let alone across the continent...

<p>Have fun!
